I picked a handful of articles about nintendo by just googling their name, and picking the first 5 articles under news. It did give me a strange article, though. But I never question google's will.

Potato Gratin:

2 pounds of potatos, Waxy or Floury are fine. 
Slice them thinly and place them into a large baking dish to make sure they fit. 

Chop up half a head of Garlic, set aside.

Grate half a pound of any block melting cheese.

Preheat the oven to 400f or 200c, then place a large pan on the stovetop under medium/high heat. 

Melt some butter in the pan, and when fully melted, fry your garlic until it starts to turn a golden brown. 

When the garlic is finished, place your potatoes  into the pan, then pour in enough cream to barely cover the potatoes (about a pint). 

Put in your salt and pepper to taste, then stir until the potatoes are covered in cream and the cream starts to look saucy. Add your cheese, and mix until homogenous. Feel free to taste for seasoning. 

Place in any green herbs you would like in the Gratin, give it one last stir, then place it into the original baking dish. 

Place into preheated oven, and cook until the crust has turned golden brown.
